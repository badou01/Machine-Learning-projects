## Project Structure

All code and experiments are in Jupyter Notebook format[attached_file:1].
- `notebooks/`: Contains individual ML projects and tutorials.
- `data/`: (If present) Datasets used for experimentation.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Features

- Examples of ML algorithms and projects.
- Step-by-step notebooks for learning and experimentation.
- Easy to extend for personal and academic use.

## Tech Stack

- **Main Language:** Jupyter Notebook (Python)[attached_file:1]
- Libraries (used across projects): NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch (as needed for deep learning).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/badou01/Machine-Learning-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```
   cd Machine-Learning-projects
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   - If a `requirements.txt` exists:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Otherwise, manually install required libraries per notebook instructions.
